* 2012/05:

Created a simple example.

Wrote some short introduction and "get started" documentation.

===

* 2011/12 - 2012/01:

Updated to compile using current version of g++, mostly by adding
	"typename" at lots of places.
Changed indentation from using spaces to tabs, and other formatting using astyle.
Changed to use scons for test programs, removed VC++ project files, made sure
	everything still compiles with MS Visual C++ 2010.
Changed license from GPL to less-restrictive BSD-like.

===

* 2008/08/25:

Code updated for compliance with more recent C++ standard/implementation.
Most in the following:
(1) to make compiler happy, added typename in a lot of places where one can
	get by without before;
(2) typedef in base class with template may not be used in derived class
	without proper qualifier;
(3) methods inherited from base class with template may require "this->"
	qualifier to use in derived classes.

Code tested with the following compiler/environments:
(1) gcc 4.2.3 on Linux (ubuntu, 32-bit and 64-bit)
(2) gcc 3.4.4 on Cygwin (Windows XP)
(3) Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2005

===

* 2001/10/08:

All code had been tested with Visual C++ 6.0 (service pack 4)
	on Windows, g++ 2.95.2 on Linux, Cygwin and Solaris, g++ 2.96
	one Linux.
External release for the first time.

===

* 1999 - 2001:

Let there be code, baby, let there be code.
